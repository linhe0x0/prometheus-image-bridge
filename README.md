Stealing Fire from Docker Hub to Your Private Realm

🚀 ‌Mission: Automatically mirror Docker Hub images to your private registry using GitHub Actions + Skopeo, bypassing regional restrictions like a modern tech titan!

* 🌉 Bridge Building: Syncs to your registry (bringing light to mortals)
* ⏱️ Auto-Update: Scheduled GitHub Actions keep your mirrors fresh

💡 ‌Why?

* 🚫 No more docker pull failures in restricted regions
* 👑 Full control over your container kingdom
* 🤖 100% automated, zero manual intervention
